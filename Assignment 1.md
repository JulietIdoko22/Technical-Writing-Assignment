## Introduction
Git is a creation of Linus Torvaldo, the originator of Linus Kernel, in April 2005 to increase the efficiency of the management and tracking of code histories. It makes it possible for a continuous availability of histories of a code and giving room for the comparison of changes made. It has proven to be the most popular Version Control System (VCS) as a result of its efficiency and easy accessibility to large number of developers. For Samyak Jain, VCSs are "software tools that assist software teams in managing changes to source code over time."

Git is not the first Version Control System that ever created. There is the **Centralized Version Control**, which makes use of a single server or source control considered to be the mai repository,. Examples include CVS, SVN, (Subversion) Perfoce, etc. 

Git bekongs to the category of the second type of VCS called **Distributed Version Control System.** According to Aditya Sriidhar, this is a system that "has a remote repository which is stored in a server and a local repository which is stored in the computer of each developer." It differs from  the Centralized because the code being worked on is stored in both a server as well as available in the local files of all the developers. 

## What is GitHub?

Simply put, GitHub is a hosting platform, in cloud, for git actions. Git repositories are kept open by GitHub for easy accessibility to interested visitors. Launched by Tom Preston-Werner, PJ Hyett and Chris Wanstrath, in 2008, it also helps to connect and gather different changes made on a particular code. 

## Why GitHub?
- GitHub makes it possible for multiple collaboration of developers and social networking of ideas.
- It is considered the storehouse of git repositories.
-  It is an open source that enables the availability of stored files to others.
-  It enables the saving and tracking of changes made during the course of coding.
- Asides being a change tracker house, it is a damage control platform where ccides are easily retrieved by a developer who loses the files in his local repository.
-  It can also serve as a marketing house for developers as repositories are there to pitch their owners to potential clients.

## Git vs. GitHub
From the foregoing, one can simply deduce that there is a difference between git and GitHub.
- While Git is the designer and creator of codes and projects, GitHub is the online hosting service. 
- Whereas git is more private and specific to a developer, GitHub is a connecting ground for multiple developers' projects.
- A code that is being done by a developer is known to him alone until made accessible to others when sent to the cloud holster, which is GitHub.
- There is an important knowledge of git before GitHub can be of any use. This means that learning of the git command line is a prerequisite to an acquaintance with the latter.

## Git Commit
This is a command used to save projects or new changes made on a project to the repository.

_**How to Commit a File**_
- Firstly transfer the file to the Staging Area: this is a sort of mediator between the local repository and the remote repository. This is done by the command, git add file.txt
- Then commit the said file by using the command, git commit -m "commit message"
## Clone
This is the act of replicating your remote repository into your local computer in order to easily navigate through both locations. One can either clone his own repository or that of another when he intends making contribution to the developer's ongoing project.  It can either be done by downloading the Zip or download it with git using https or CSS.

_**Methods**_
- Go to the main page of the intended remote repository and click on clone.

-  A URL will be shown and you will copy it.
- Open your terminal or Windows git bash, and navigate to the directory that you want the cloned repository to be located.
- Type the git clone command (git clone) along with the URL copied). Eg. git clone <URL>
- Press the enter key.

## Pull
A Pull request is done in a situation where one who has a Read permission intends to contribute to an ongoing project. This means collaborating with changes made In a repository. It is mostly done by forking a repo especially when you have no access to an open source repo.

**_To Fork a Repo_**
- On the top right corner of a repo, click on the **FORK** button.

- A new copy which includes all the copies, branches and commits made on that repo will automatically appear under your own own account with a new URL.
- Finally, the clone is done by by using the clone command, git clone <repo URL> on your local terminal.
- Create a new branch using the command, git checkout -b <branch name>.
- Also generate a new remote for the original repo you forked using the command, git remote add upst
- After making the changes, adding the changes to the branch and commiting it, you also need to create a pull request which will notify the owner of the repository whether to merge your changes or not.

## GitHub Desktop vs. GitHub CLI
**GitHub Desktop** means interacting the GitHub using a GUI. This application can aid you perform most git commands, like pull, push, commit, clone, etc., right from your desktop. Hardly any difference exists between this application and that of the website.

However, **GitHub CLI** (Command Line Interface) is a command line commands that helps you perform GitHub functions like pulling, pushing, adding, commiting, etc., from your local terminal.
